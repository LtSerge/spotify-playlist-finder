1) The code provides a query to spotify for a list of categories and appends it to webpage as JSON Data. Design a simple UI to display this data in a list of cards.

No need to make this data pretty you can leave it as raw data. Documentation can be found here: https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/#endpoint-get-a-categories-playlists
